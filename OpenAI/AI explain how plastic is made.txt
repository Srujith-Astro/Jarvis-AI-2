Plastic is made from a variety of materials, including natural gas, crude oil and coal. The process of making plastic begins with liquefying these materials to form a viscous liquid. This liquid is then heated and combined with certain chemicals to give plastic its desired properties. It is then molded or extruded into the desired shape and cooled to form the final product.
