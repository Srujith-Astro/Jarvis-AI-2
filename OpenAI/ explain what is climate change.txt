OpenAI response for prompt: Jarvis using AI explain what is climate change
***********

 Climate change is a long-term shift in weather patterns and average temperatures caused mainly by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, that trap heat in the atmosphere. Climate change affects many aspects of our lives, including our health, our food and water supply, and our infrastructure. As climate change continues, temperatures are expected to rise, sea levels will rise, and extreme weather events will become more frequent and more severe.
