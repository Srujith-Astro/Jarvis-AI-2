OpenAI response for prompt: using AI what is used escape
***********

 Escape plan is used to plan an escape route from a dangerous or difficult situation. It can involve planning an escape route and/or resources, as well as tactics for avoiding detection or capture. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to plan an escape route more effectively, by taking into account factors such as terrain, population density, and the presence of law enforcement in the area. AI can also be used to analyze past escape attempts to determine which strategies and tactics have been successful and which have failed.
