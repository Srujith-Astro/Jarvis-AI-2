 You can use AI to create a Python script that can multiply two numbers. To do this, you would need to use a deep learning algorithm to train the model. First, you would need to gather data for the two numbers you want to multiply. Then, you would need to create a model that can learn from the data and make predictions. Finally, you would need to test the model and make sure it works correctly.
